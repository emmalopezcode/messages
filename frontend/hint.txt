if a property of a component is undefined, make sure you include it in the main.jsx

if you are recieving a 'json syntax parse' error
    make sure that you are expecting any body at all
    and check the server side

when you attach a new piece to the store -- what connects it to the hooks is having the same name -- it just knows...

if you need the this.props.updateCnvs() -> basically do it before you pass it through   
    -cnvOverview would be done in signIN
