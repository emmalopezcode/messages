if you get a [property of 'status' of undefined] on server side
    something happened during the query
    how to fix:
        ask yourself
        is there things I am setting to null that arent allowed to be null?
        and just generally am i following the necessary format of the sql table
        if not set them before sending the set query
        also just run the query on the mysql client to make sure you have proper syntaxd
        if its about like make sure it is `like`

if you get a [err_http_headers_sent]
    it is because multiple responses tried to be sent
    furthermore it is LIKELY because you do not have the EXACT endpoint represented in your code

if you try to create a table and get an error at line one ''
    it is because you should be using the back apostrophe `

if you get a [propert of 'release' of undefined] on client side
    you likely are not actually calling the function, make sure it is referenced in main.js

if you are getting upsetti spaghetti about a very specialized vld if statement think of this:
    what i want is for it to be --- other wise i will throw an error

if when when you run a query with the runner and then the next one crashes the server or just doesnt respond
    you likely have a hanging connection, make sure your callbacks are in place

if you see a Object is possibly 'undefined' or 'null'
    you need to put a ? before you chain methods onto it
